## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Installation
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Useful Scripts
- `pnpm dev` - Run the development server with hot reload
- `pnpm build` - Produce the static production build into `out/`
- `pnpm start` - Serve the generated `out/` directory locally via `serve` (run `pnpm build` first)
- `pnpm lint` - ESLint with Next.js configuration
- `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript program diagnostics

*Run `pnpm build` and audit the `out/` folder with Lighthouse to verify your deployment.*

## Deployment
### Static Export (CDN / Static Hosts)
```bash
pnpm build
```
The build artefacts live in the `out/` directory and can be served by any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront, nginx, Apache, etc.).

### Docker (Static by Default)
```bash
docker build -t vetra-ui:static .
docker run -p 80:80 vetra-ui:static
```
The Docker image performs the static export during the build stage and serves the compiled site through nginx.

### Switching to SSR Later
If you need server-side rendering, update `next.config.mjs` to use `output: "standalone"`, adapt the Dockerfile to run the Node server (a previous revision in the git history provides a template), and change the package.json `start` script back to `next start`. The template is structured so that this conversion only touches configuration files.
## Troubleshooting
- **`pnpm install` fails** - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed and delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` only if instructed.
- **Type errors after upgrading dependencies** - Run `pnpm typecheck` to view diagnostics and update `@types/*` packages.
- **Static assets missing on export** - Confirm assets live under `public/` and are referenced with absolute `/asset.ext` paths.
- **Styles not updating in dev** - Remove `.next/` and restart `pnpm dev` to clear Tailwind's cache.
- **Font fetch failures** - Fonts are bundled locally under `app/fonts`, so builds succeed without external requests. If you swap fonts, update the files and license notice there.
